The CodeBehind and CodeFile attributes are both used in ASP.NET to link the .aspx markup file to its associated C# or VB.NET code file, but they are used in different types of ASP.NET projects and have slightly different purposes:

1. CodeBehind Attribute:
Used in Web Application Projects.
CodeBehind is a design-time attribute that tells Visual Studio where to find the associated code file for the .aspx page during development.
It is mainly for use within the Visual Studio environment and is not required or used by the ASP.NET runtime after the code is compiled into the assembly (DLL).
Key Point: Once compiled, the .aspx file and the code-behind file are bundled into the same DLL.


//example
<%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeBehind="PerformanceIndicatorExcelForm.aspx.cs" Inherits="YourNamespace.PerformanceIndicatorExcelForm" %>

Here, the C# code for the page is in PerformanceIndicatorExcelForm.aspx.cs, and the compiled DLL will contain both the .aspx logic and the code-behind.


2. CodeFile Attribute:
Used in Web Site Projects.
CodeFile is used in Web Site projects, where the code is dynamically compiled at runtime, rather than pre-compiled into a DLL like in Web Application projects.
This attribute specifies the physical location of the code-behind file, which ASP.NET uses at runtime to dynamically compile the .aspx and .cs files.
The source code and markup files are compiled at runtime in Web Site projects, and the output is stored in a temporary folder.

//example
<%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeFile="PerformanceIndicatorExcelForm.aspx.cs" Inherits="YourNamespace.PerformanceIndicatorExcelForm" %>

Here, CodeFile directly points to the .cs file and is compiled when the page is requested for the first time.


<Key Differences>
Project Type:
CodeBehind is used in Web Application Projects (compiled before deployment).
CodeFile is used in Web Site Projects (dynamically compiled at runtime).

Compilation Time:
In a Web Application, both .aspx and .aspx.cs files are pre-compiled into a DLL when the project is built.
In a Web Site, the files are compiled dynamically when they are first requested.

Development Experience:
CodeBehind is primarily for design-time and used by Visual Studio. Once compiled, this link is no longer needed.
CodeFile is required at runtime because the code is compiled when requested by the server.

<When to Use Which>
If you are working in a Web Application Project, use CodeBehind.
If you are working in a Web Site Project, use CodeFile.
